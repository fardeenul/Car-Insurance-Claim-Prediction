# Car-Insurance-Claim-Prediction
This GitHub repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on predicting car insurance claims. The goal of the project is to build a model that accurately estimates the likelihood of a customer making a claim during the policy period. The repository provides a step-by-step implementation using R, with logistic regression as the chosen model.

Key Features:

    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The project includes data cleaning techniques to handle missing values in the dataset. Missing values in the "credit_score" and "annual_mileage" columns are filled with the mean values to ensure data integrity.

    Feature Engineering: The project performs feature engineering by selecting relevant features for model training. The "id" column is removed as it is not relevant to the prediction task. The "gender" column is converted to a factor variable for analysis.

    Logistic Regression Modeling: The project builds logistic regression models, each with a single feature, to predict car insurance claims. A for loop iterates through each feature, training a model and calculating accuracy based on predictions.

    Model Evaluation: The project evaluates model performance using accuracy as the evaluation metric. The accuracy scores for each feature are stored in a data frame for analysis. The best performing feature and its corresponding accuracy score are identified.

    GitHub Summary: The repository includes a GitHub summary file that provides an overview of the project, code, and key findings. It highlights the steps taken to clean the data, select features, train logistic regression models, and evaluate performance.

Contributions and Future Work:
Contributions to the project can include enhancements to the data cleaning process, additional feature engineering techniques, and the exploration of other machine learning models for comparison. Future work may involve refining the model, considering additional evaluation metrics, and deploying the model for real-time predictions.

This GitHub repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding the prediction of car insurance claims using logistic regression and can be used as a starting point for similar projects or for learning purposes.
